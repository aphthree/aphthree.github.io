                        Shotokan Karate-Do was founded by Gichin Funakoshi (1868-1957) and is an amalgamation of three
                        major regional schools of Okinawan martial arts: Shuri-te, Naha-te, and Tomari-te. Okinawan
                        martial arts had been heavily influenced by Chinese martial arts for many centuries, due to the
                        presence of a major port at Naha, close to the towns of Shuri and Tomari. After the banning of
                        weapons in Okinawa, first by the Okinawan Emperor and later by the Japanese Satsuma Clan,
                        development of the Okinawan martial arts accelerated. Major changes were made in the 19th
                        century by a number of masters, including some such as Itosu and Azato, who would later be
                        Funakoshi's instructors. Little is known in detail about the martial arts of the period, due to
                        the destruction of the major Okinawan towns and Shuri Castle (including all written records)
                        during the invasion of Japan in the Second World War.

                        Funakoshi began studying Shorin-ryu in the city of Shori as a child. As karate was illegal until
                        about 1901, Funakoshi studied in secret. Around 1905, when nearing 40 years of age, Funakoshi
                        opened his first karate class. In 1921, he was requested to give a demonstration of martial arts
                        to the Emperor of Japan. The Emperor was so impressed that Funakoshi was invited to perform a
                        demonstration at the First National Athletics Exhibition in Tokyo in 1922. In 1924, karate began
                        development in Japanese universities, and the first official karate dojo was opened by Funakoshi
                        in 1936. Called the Shotokan, or Shoto's Hall, this dojo gives its name to the style of karate
                        developed by Funakoshi — Shoto, which may be translated as "billowing pine trees," was
                        Funakoshi's pen name while writing poetry in his youth.

                            Gichin Funakoshi passed much of the responsibility for teaching to his son Yoshitake (or
                            Gigo) early in the 1930s. Under Yoshitake's leadership, Shotokan Karate was substantially
                            revised. Changes included the introduction of low stances and long attacks in combination,
                            an expanded range of kicks, changes to the way kicks were delivered, and the implementation
                            of pre-arranged kumite and free fight training. In 1936, <i>Karate Do Kyohan</i> was
                            published, establishing a technical framework for Shotokan, and in 1943 Gichin and Yoshitake
                            published <i>Karate-do Nyumon</i>. In 1945, after a lifetime of illness, Yoshitake Funakoshi
                            died. Gichin Funakoshi died int 1957, eight years after the initial formation of the

                        As Shotokan karate grew in size, it was inevitable that various instructors would have differing
                        opinions on its development. In 1956, a group of Shotokan karate-ka, opposed to a growing sport
                        orientation, formed the Shotokai (Shoto's Council). The main body remained the Japan Karate
                        Association (JKA). In 1977, again relating to the perception of an increasing emphasis on sport
                        rather than to karate's budo or spiritual nature, Sensei Hirokazu Kanazawa, one of the most
                        technically brilliant Shotokan practitioners, formed Shotokan Karate International (SKI).

                        Sensei Stephen Xepapas started martial arts training in 1970 at the age of 15 when, inspired by
                        the infamous 'judo chop' in a James Bond film, he went to learn Shotokan Karate from Sensei
                        Othmar Buchmann at the Tasmanian University. Sensei Othmar was a very experienced karateka who
                        had trained under Sensei Hirokazu Kanazawa in Scotland. When this club was closed, Sensei
                        Stephen turned to judo, becoming a member of the Tasmanian State team as an orange belt. Sensei
                        Stephen returned to Shotokan when the University Club reopened in 1972, again training under
                        Sensei Othmar.
